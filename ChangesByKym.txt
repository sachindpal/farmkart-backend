For Login Api & Telemetry : 
1. Mobile number and password should be encrypted in Telemetry (store them before decoding the frontend input).
2. Change the login flow (check staging area first, verify the password too, remove the send OTP logic, etc.).
3. Telemetry should be a class, and correlationId and sessionId should be part of the constructor.
4. Change addTelemetry so that we only need to append a new object without reading the whole JSON file.
